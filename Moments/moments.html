I enrolled 						myself in ROTC because for me enrolling in CWTS is for gays 						only. I cannot forget that we won the Tactical Inspection, it's						like all our efforts are paid off. And as a reward to cadets, 						they held a ROTC Festival and it was so fun.				</b>			</div>		</div>		<div class="Content2">			<div class="imageRight"><img src="../Images/drummer.png"/></div>			<div class="textLeft">				<b class="blackText">					<br>						I cannot forget the first time I attend a band competition.						It was like I'm a paranoid thinking what if I misplayed a beat 						and what if they don't like how I play the drums?

But thanks to God it was worth 						the play.				</b>			</div>		</div>		<div class="Content3">			<div class="imageLeft"><img src="../Images/mati.png"/></div>			<div class="textRight">				<b class="whiteText">					<br>						The best gift I received in my life was when we visit Mati City.						It was the day after tommorow of my birthday when visited Mati.						I was so amazed to see the so called "Sleeping Dinosaur". As I 						saw it it came to my mind that it is so close to a turtle not a 						Dino like they said. After that I bought a turtle souvenir.				</b>			</div>		</div>	</div>	<div class="header">		<div class="home">			<a class="hover" href="../index.html"><b class="whiteText">Home</b></a>		</div>		<div class="menu">			<a class="hover" href="../Personal/personal.html"><b class="whiteText">Personal&nbsp&nbsp</b></a>|			<a class="hover" href="moments.html"><b class="whiteText">&nbspMoments&nbsp&nbsp</b></a>|			<a class="hover" href="../Travel/travel.html"><b class="whiteText">&nbspTravel</b></a>		</div>		</div>	<div class="footer">		Copyright: William James L.
